# Drip SDK (Python)

Drip is a Python SDK for **usage-based tracking and execution logging** in systems where spend is tied to computation — AI agents, APIs, batch jobs, and infra workloads.

This **Core SDK** is optimized for pilots: capture usage and run data first, add billing later.

**One line to start tracking:** `drip.track_usage(customer_id, meter, quantity)`

## 60-Second Quickstart (Core SDK)

### 1. Install

```bash
pip install drip-sdk
```

### 2. Set your API key

```bash
# Secret key — full access (server-side only)
export DRIP_API_KEY=sk_test_...

# Or public key — usage, customers, billing (safe for client-side)
export DRIP_API_KEY=pk_test_...
```

### 3. Create a customer and track usage

```python
from drip import drip

# Create a customer first
customer = drip.create_customer(external_customer_id="user_123")

# Track usage — that's it
drip.track_usage(customer_id=customer.id, meter="api_calls", quantity=1)
```

The `drip` singleton reads `DRIP_API_KEY` from your environment automatically.

### Alternative: Explicit Configuration

```python
from drip import Drip

# Auto-reads DRIP_API_KEY from environment
client = Drip()

# Or pass config explicitly with a secret key (full access)
client = Drip(api_key="sk_test_...")

# Or with a public key (limited scope, safe for client-side)
client = Drip(api_key="pk_test_...")
```

### Full Example

```python
from drip import drip

# Verify connectivity
drip.ping()

# Create a customer (at least one of external_customer_id or onchain_address required)
customer = drip.create_customer(external_customer_id="user_123")

# Record usage
drip.track_usage(
    customer_id=customer.id,
    meter="llm_tokens",
    quantity=842,
    metadata={"model": "gpt-4o-mini"}
)

# Record execution lifecycle
drip.record_run(
    customer_id=customer.id,
    workflow="research-agent",
    events=[
        {"eventType": "llm.call", "quantity": 1700, "units": "tokens"},
        {"eventType": "tool.call", "quantity": 1},
    ],
    status="COMPLETED"
)

print(f"Customer {customer.id}: usage + run recorded")
```

**Expected result:**
- No exceptions
- Events appear in the Drip dashboard within seconds

## Core Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `customer_id` | The entity you're attributing usage to |
| `meter` | What's being measured (tokens, calls, time, etc.) |
| `quantity` | Numeric usage value |
| `run` | A single request or job execution |
| `correlation_id` | Optional. Your trace/request ID for linking Drip data with your APM (OpenTelemetry, Datadog, etc.) |

**Status values:** `PENDING` | `RUNNING` | `COMPLETED` | `FAILED`

**Event schema:** Payloads are schema-flexible. Drip stores events as structured JSON and does not enforce a fixed event taxonomy. CamelCase is accepted.

> **Distributed tracing:** Pass `correlation_id` to `start_run()`, `record_run()`, or `emit_event()` to cross-reference Drip billing with your observability stack. See [FULL_SDK.md](./FULL_SDK.md#distributed-tracing-correlation_id) for details.

## Idempotency Keys

Every mutating SDK method (`charge`, `track_usage`, `emit_event`) accepts an optional `idempotency_key` parameter. The server uses this key to deduplicate requests — if two requests share the same key, only the first is processed.

`record_run` generates idempotency keys internally for its batch events (using `external_run_id` when provided, otherwise deterministic keys).

### Auto-generated keys (default)

When you omit `idempotency_key`, the SDK generates one automatically. The auto key is:

- **Unique per call** — two separate calls with identical parameters produce different keys (a monotonic counter ensures this).
- **Stable across retries** — the key is generated once and reused for all retry attempts of that call, so network retries are safely deduplicated.
- **Deterministic** — no randomness; keys are reproducible for debugging.

This means you get **free retry safety** with zero configuration.

### When to pass explicit keys

Pass your own `idempotency_key` when you need **application-level deduplication** — e.g., to guarantee that a specific business operation is billed exactly once, even across process restarts:

```python
customer = drip.create_customer(external_customer_id="user_123")

drip.charge(
    customer_id=customer.id,
    meter="api_calls",
    quantity=1,
    idempotency_key=f"order_{order_id}_charge",  # your business-level key
)
```

Common patterns:
- `order_{order_id}` — one charge per order
- `run_{run_id}_step_{step_index}` — one charge per pipeline step
- `invoice_{invoice_id}` — one charge per invoice

## Installation Options

```bash
pip install drip-sdk           # core only
pip install drip-sdk[fastapi]  # FastAPI helpers

## SDK Variants

| Variant | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Core SDK** (recommended for pilots) | Usage tracking + execution logging only |

## Core SDK Methods

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `ping()` | Verify API connection |
| `create_customer(...)` | Create a customer (see below) |
| `get_customer(customer_id)` | Get customer details |
| `list_customers(options)` | List all customers |

### Creating Customers

All parameters are optional, but at least one of `external_customer_id` or `onchain_address` must be provided:

```python
# Simplest — just your internal user ID
customer = drip.create_customer(external_customer_id="user_123")

# With an on-chain address (for on-chain billing)
customer = drip.create_customer(
    onchain_address="0x1234...",
    external_customer_id="user_123"
)

# Internal/non-billing customer (for tracking only)
customer = drip.create_customer(
    external_customer_id="internal-team",
    is_internal=True
)
```

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `external_customer_id` | `str` | No* | Your internal user/account ID |
| `onchain_address` | `str` | No* | Customer's Ethereum address |
| `is_internal` | `bool` | No | Mark as internal (non-billing). Default: `False` |
| `metadata` | `dict` | No | Arbitrary key-value metadata |

\*At least one of `external_customer_id` or `onchain_address` is required.

## Async Core SDK

```python
from drip import AsyncDrip

async with AsyncDrip(api_key="sk_test_...") as client:
    await client.ping()

    # Create a customer
    customer = await client.create_customer(external_customer_id="user_123")

    await client.track_usage(
        customer_id=customer.id,
        meter="api_calls",
        quantity=1
    )

    result = await client.record_run(
        customer_id=customer.id,
        workflow="research-agent",
        events=[...],
        status="COMPLETED"
    )
```

---

## Who This Is For

- AI agents (token metering, tool calls, execution traces)
- API companies (per-request billing, endpoint attribution)
- RPC providers (multi-chain call tracking)
- Cloud/infra (compute seconds, storage, bandwidth)

## Full SDK (Billing, Webhooks, Integrations)

For billing, webhooks, middleware, and advanced features:

```python
from drip import Drip
```

See **[FULL_SDK.md](./FULL_SDK.md)** for complete documentation.

## Error Handling

```python
from drip import Drip, DripError, DripAPIError

client = Drip(api_key="sk_test_...")
customer = client.create_customer(external_customer_id="user_123")

try:
    result = client.track_usage(customer_id=customer.id, meter="api_calls", quantity=1)
except DripAPIError as e:
    print(f"API error {e.status_code}: {e.message}")
except DripError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
